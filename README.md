My STudent Automated Registration System (MySTARS)

## Overview

The following are information about the application:

- It is a university application meant for each Schoolâ€™s academic staff and
  undergraduate students.
- The application allows the creation of courses and adding of student records as well
  as registration of courses and students. There will be an administrator mode for
  academic staff and user mode for students.
- At the start of each semester registration period, students will be required to register
  for their courses. Each course (subject) will have its course code, its corresponding
  index number information, the class schedules and venue, and available vacancy.
- Courses may have lectures only, lectures and tutorial only or lectures, tutorial and
  laboratory sessions.
- Students on waitlist will be placed in a queue whereby when there is available slot,
  the first in queue will be allocated the slot. A notification will be sent to the student.

# Use STARSUI.java to run the program!

The images below show the console displays when logged in as a student and a staff respectively.

### NOTE:

Our project was done on VS code so there might be some incompatibility errors when opening it on other platforms such as Eclipse.

### Text files:

As the program runs, changes will be reflected directly in courseData.txt and studentData.txt. There will be no changes made to staffData.txt. For your reference, the following shows the starting state for both courseData.txt and studentData.txt. This is to demonstrate each function to clearly see the change in the database depending on the course of action taken in the program.

### Email notification

These are the log in details for the dummy gmail accounts created so that you are able to log in into both these accounts to verify that the email notification has been sent/received.

#### For the staff:

Email address: staffaccntustar@gmail.com <br/>
Password: P@ssword12345

#### For the student:

Email address: student1bobtan@gmail.com <br/>
Password: P@ssword12345

#### On adding relevant .jar files for email notification:

- Using the project manager for java extension in VScode,
- Add mail.jar and activation.jar from the JarFiles folder by clicking the + sign next to Referenced Libraries node in project view
- If this step is not done, the email notification class will not be able to import the packages needed to send an email!!
